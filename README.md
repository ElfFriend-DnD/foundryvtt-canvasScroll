Similar to Roll20, I want to be able to use my scroll wheel to pan instead of zoom.

## Installation

Module JSON:
```

```

## Key Features & Changes

### Scroll Behavior

Intended scroll behavior is to pan instead of zoom.

## Options

| **Name** | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| none     | Nothing     |

This sheet respects the 5e System setting: "Disable Experience Tracking"

### Compatibility

I'm honestly not sure how well this will play with modules that affect character sheets, I'll try to test as many as possible but if somethign is obviously breaking please create and issue here and I'll see what I can do.
